        <h2><em> DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTIVE AND PASSIVE SECURITY  THREATS </em> </h2>
        <p>
        Although both active and passive attacks are a part of security attacks, if you compare active and passive attacks, both of them have a lot of differences between them. The main differences between them are made based on how they are done and how much damage they do to the system and its resources. Difference between active and passive attacks in network security are listed down below:

In active attacks, modification of messages is done, but on the other hand, in passive attacks, the information remains unchanged.
The active attack causes damage to the integrity and availability of the system, but passive attacks cause damage to data confidentiality. 
In active attacks, attention is given to detection, while in the other one, attention is given to prevention. 
The resources can be changed in active attacks, but passive attacks have no impact on the resources.
The active attack influences the system services, but the information or data is acquired in passive attacks.
Inactive attacks, information is gathered through passive attacks to attack the system, while passive attacks are achieved by collecting confidential information such as private chats and passwords. 
Active attacks are challenging to be prohibited, but passive attacks are easy to prevent.
            
           <h2><em> malwares </em> </h2>  
            <p>
                Types of malware
There are a number of different ways of categorizing malware; the first is by how the malicious software spreads. You've probably heard the words virus, trojan, and worm used interchangeably, but as Symantec explains, they describe three subtly different ways malware can infect target computers:

A worm is a standalone piece of malicious software that reproduces itself and spreads from computer to computer.
A virus is a piece of computer code that inserts itself within the code of another standalone program, then forces that program to take malicious action and spread itself.
A trojan is a program that cannot reproduce itself but masquerades as something the user wants and tricks them into activating it so it can do its damage and spread.
Malware can also be installed on a computer "manually" by the attackers themselves, either by gaining physical access to the computer or using privilege escalation to gain remote administrator access. 

Another way to categorize malware is by what it does once it has successfully infected its victim's computers. There are a wide range of potential attack techniques used by malware:

Spyware is defined by Webroot Cybersecurity as "malware used for the purpose of secretly gathering data on an unsuspecting user." In essence, it spies on your behavior as you use your computer, and on the data you send and receive, usually with the purpose of sending that information to a third party. A keylogger is a specific kind of spyware that records all the keystrokes a user makesâ€”great for stealing passwords.

        <h2><em> software and hardware to protect networks  </em> </h2>
        <p>
            Firewalls. Firewalls are hardware appliances and software programs that act as a barrier between incoming traffic and the network. The firewall compares data packets that are sent over the network to predefined policies and rules that indicate whether or not the data should be permitted into the network

         <h2><em> network protocols </em> </h2>
        
        <p>
        SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is an encryption-based Internet security protocol. It was first developed by Netscape in 1995 for the purpose of ensuring privacy, authentication, and data integrity in Internet communications. SSL is the predecessor to the modern TLS encryption used today.

        <p>
        The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol that is used to transmit virtually all files and other data on the World Wide Web, whether they're HTML files, image files, query results, or anything else. Usually, HTTP takes place through TCP/IP sockets.

        <h2><em> digital certificates and certificate authorities </em> </h2>
        <p>
            Digital certificates are issued by trusted parties, called certificate authorities, to verify the identity of an entity, such as a client or server.

The digital certificate serves two purposes: it verifies the owner's identity and it makes the owner's public key available. It is issued with an expiration date, after which it is no longer guaranteed by the certificate authority (CA).

To obtain a digital certificate, you send a request to the CA of your choice, such as Verisign, or RSA. The request includes your distinguished name, your public key, and your signature. A distinguished name (DN) is a unique identifier for each user or host for which you are applying for a certificate. The CA checks your signature using your public key and performs some level of verification of your identity (this varies with different CAs). After verification, the CA sends you a signed digital certificate that contains your distinguished name, your public key, the CA's distinguished name, and the signature of the certificate authority. You store this signed certificate in your key database.

When you send this certificate to a receiver, the receiver performs two steps to verify your identity:
Uses your public key that comes with the certificate to check your digital signature.
Verifies that the CA that issued your certificate is legitimate and trustworthy. To do this, the receiver needs the public key of the CA. The receiver might already hold an assured copy of the public key of the CA in their key database, but if not, the receiver must acquire an additional digital certificate to obtain the public key of the CA. This certificate might in turn depend on the digital certificate of another CA; there might be a hierarchy of certificates issued by multiple CAs, each depending on the validity of the next. Eventually, however, the receiver needs the public key of the root CA. The root CA is the CA at the top of the hierarchy. To trust the validity of the digital certificate of the root CA, the public-key user must receive that digital certificate in a secure manner, such as through a download from an authenticated server, or with preloaded software received from a reliable source, or on a securely delivered diskette.
Many applications that send a digital certificate to a receiver send not just their own certificate, but also all of the CA digital certificates necessary to verify the hierarchy of certificates up to the root CA certificate.

For a digital certificate to be entirely trustworthy, the owner of the digital certificate must have carefully protected their private key, for example, by encrypting it on their computer's hard drive. If their private key has been compromised, an imposter could misuse their digital certificate.

You can use self-signed digital certificates for testing purposes. A self-signed digital certificate contains your distinguished name, your public key, and your signature.
