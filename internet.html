        <h1><em> DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTIVE AND PASSIVE SECURITY  THREATS </em> </h1>
        <p>
        Although both active and passive attacks are a part of security attacks, if you compare active and passive attacks, both of them have a lot of differences between them. The main differences between them are made based on how they are done and how much damage they do to the system and its resources. Difference between active and passive attacks in network security are listed down below:

In active attacks, modification of messages is done, but on the other hand, in passive attacks, the information remains unchanged.
The active attack causes damage to the integrity and availability of the system, but passive attacks cause damage to data confidentiality. 
In active attacks, attention is given to detection, while in the other one, attention is given to prevention. 
The resources can be changed in active attacks, but passive attacks have no impact on the resources.
The active attack influences the system services, but the information or data is acquired in passive attacks.
Inactive attacks, information is gathered through passive attacks to attack the system, while passive attacks are achieved by collecting confidential information such as private chats and passwords. 
Active attacks are challenging to be prohibited, but passive attacks are easy to prevent.
